=Architecture
* Currently, the app renders index.html and <b>handle any request from index</b> by using MainController.
* Desire is the model/backend of the desire list, currently only one table implmented.
* DesiresController mainly <b>provides the web services</b> for creation, deletion, updating and listing.

here is the class diagram for controllers:

and here is the model diagram:

=Provided API
The application is <b>RESTful</b>. It provides the basic operation on <b>Desire</b>, such as 
* DesiresController.create
* DesiresController.destroy
* DesiresController.index
* DesiresController.show
* DesiresController.update

eg: (the following examples ignore the <b>authenticaty_tokens</b>)

===for creation:

<tt>POST /desires</tt>

with the post data:

<tt>desire[name]=macbook</tt>

===for updating:

<tt>POST /desires/1</tt>

with the post data:

<tt>_method=put&desire[price]=100000</tt>

===for show one item:

<tt>GET /desires/2</tt>

===javascript (jquery) example:

The following code will retrive all desires and log to the debug console of js:

<tt>$.get('/desires', function(data) { console.log(data); }, 'json')</tt>

The following code will create a new desire named <b>macbook</b>:

<tt>$.post('/desires', 'desire[name]=macbook', function(data) { console.log(data.message); }, 'json') </tt>

Because the accepted type is 'json', the application will encapsulate the response with the following json format:

<tt>{ message: 'message for the operation', status: 1 or 0 ,.... }</tt>
